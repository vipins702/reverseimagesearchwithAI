      "## Pro Tips from Photographers\n\n" +
      "### Tip 1: Always Keep RAW Files\n" +
      "If you shoot in RAW format, **never delete RAW files** - only remove duplicate JPG exports.\n\n" +
      "### Tip 2: Use Metadata to Identify Originals\n" +
      "Check EXIF data:\n" +
      "- Original photos have camera metadata (shutter speed, ISO, lens)\n" +
      "- Duplicates/edits often lack this data\n" +
      "- Right-click photo → Properties → Details (Windows)\n" +
      "- Right-click photo → Get Info (Mac)\n\n" +
      "### Tip 3: Batch Rename Before Scanning\n" +
      "Rename photos to: YYYY-MM-DD_EventName_001.jpg\n\n" +
      "Example: 2025-01-26_VacationParis_001.jpg\n\n" +
      "This makes duplicates easier to spot visually.\n\n" +
      "### Tip 4: Create a 'Review Later' Folder\n" +
      "Instead of deleting immediately:\n" +
      "1. Move suspected duplicates to Review folder\n" +
      "2. Check them manually over the next week\n" +
      "3. Delete permanently only after verification\n\n" +
      "### Tip 5: Schedule Monthly Duplicate Scans\n" +
      "Set a calendar reminder to scan for duplicates **every month**:\n" +
      "- Prevents accumulation of duplicates\n" +
      "- Takes only 5-10 minutes with automated tools\n" +
      "- Keeps library organized year-round\n\n" +
